/**
 * This class contains values.  Objects of this class are the terminal
 * nodes of an expression tree.
 * <b>
 * Note that there is a constructor for Double values, but not Float.
 * CORBA defines that all floating point expressions are evaluated as
 * double, and that the result is coerced back to float if necessary.
 * <b>
 * Note also that there is a constructor for long values, but not for
 * int or short.  CORBA defines that all integral expressions are evaluated
 * as unsigned long.  A CORBA long is a Java int.  There is no unsigned int
 * in Java, so the next larger type, long, is used.
