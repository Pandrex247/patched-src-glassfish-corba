By default, rmic now uses an ASM-based classfile parser. New Java code versions can be supported simply by changing
the dependent ASM version. It is also possible to fall back to the legacy binary classfile parser in
JDK versions 1.8 and 9 by setting the system property org.glassfish.rmic.UseLegacyClassParsing to "true".

Note that if no version of ASM is in the classpath, rmic will attempt to fallback to the legacy parser in the earlier
JDK versions.
